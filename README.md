## Notes
After buinding Huddle Landing page with Coder Coder, I don't think this website was difficult to build, but even so, I got myself a little torn between preserving it's original body's padding or the card's width and height.
In the end, I decided to keep the card's width and height, otherwise, depending on the devide's size, the card could not keep it's proportions and be more stretched in one direction than the other.
